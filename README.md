# Object-Oriented-Programming-SVG-Logo-Maker

# Description:

  This project is all about SVG logo file maker. This project will help a developer to generate his/her own SVG logo without having to worry about paying for another another graphic designer.

  One problem with most projects is that most developers pay for logo designer. This could be because of the laziness of the developer or doesn't want to work on it or the developer hasn't mastered down on how to create logo file. Also  possibly the developer hasn't a good idea of what to include with the logo.

  This SVG logo maker will allow the developer to answer a series of specific questions and create SVG logo based on the developer's response. It will take a couple minutes and provide the developer with the ability to make their project complete and more professional.
